Configuring Paystack for the Application


To enable seamless payment processing within our application, we'll integrate Paystack, a secure and efficient payment gateway. Follow the steps below to configure Paystack:

-Sign Up on Paystack:
Sign in to your Paystack dashboard and navigate to the "Developers" section to get your API keys. If you don't have an account sign up.

-Install the flutter_paystack Package:
In your Flutter project, add the flutter_paystack package as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file and then run flutter pub get.

-Configure API Keys
Initialize paystack with your public key in your main entry point.

-Initiate Payment:
In the "Confirm Order" section of your app, when the user confirms their order and wishes to make a payment, integrate the Paystack payment process.

-Handle Payment Result:
The checkout method returns a ChargeResponse object that indicates whether the payment was successful. Based on the response, you can update the order status and proceed accordingly.

-Error Handling:
Implement error handling to manage scenarios where the payment fails or is canceled by the user.

-Testing and Deployment:
Thoroughly test the payment flow in a sandbox, emulator or test environment provided by Paystack before deploying it to your production application.
